The sadness of millenia, the weight of empires, let me be, now, let me
be.

The judgement abundant and silent mockery, I wish you away, as a mad
man, I wish.

The loneliness of stars, the solitude of stone, I feel you deeply, you
sorround me.

The regret of soldiers and shame of thieves I must admit, alone, I
must.

Now are the stars waiting, for swift action and power.  They await the
death and destruction of the blasphemous cities. 

To burn them I wish, to bring all to the ground.  To scream my anger
and anguish, to shatter all!

Chaos I ride. This stallion wildest and bravest.  This energy
unleashed I must control, for many deaths has it created, and many
tears has it shed.

It was once imprisoned, and sick and lost.  But the legends say it can
be tamed, and it can be free and bright.

All I have now is the clock and my nightmares.  All I have is the
torment and rage.

All I have is a speck of hope, that has travelled worlds with me.  I
still believe, as a mad man, I believe.

Onwards I go, to moon and sun.
